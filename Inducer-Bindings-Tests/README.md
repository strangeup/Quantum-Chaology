#Contents of this Folder:

-arpack-with-comments.hpp : my interpretation of Andreas' code

-minimal_example.cpp : an example showing the right arguments for the bindings (it compiles at least) please note
this gives unrealistic eigenvalues so there is probably something very wrong with the implementation

-procedure.txt: a file containing the steps I took to install pyublas ext

-siteconf.py: examples settings for setup
