###Minkowski Bouligand Dimension 
Code written to allow easy manipulation and calculation of "box counting" dimension.

`box_counter_proto.h` : contains class structure for use in this technique

`box_counter.cpp` : example of implementation for use with contours (read from output files in format 
specified by 'D' flag in [my adapted marching squares algorithm](https://github.com/strangeup/Quantum-Chaology/blob/master/Marching%20Squares/Marching_Squares.h).

`box_counter` and `usage.md` : executable and explanation of usage.
